Ubuntu Shell Script to setup Development Environment

I have created this script to setup development environment after fresh installation of Ubuntu. This will install following development environments and tools for you:

- Node.js
- NVM
- NPM
- MongoDB
- Forever
- git
- grunt
- bower
- vim
- curl
- python
- jre/jdk
- gimp
- zip unzip and rar tools
- filezilla
- tlp

It would demand yes/no inputs on terminal from user therefore it is not fully automated for now.

# Execution

Download the .sh file in the repository and make it executable

`chmod a+x my_ubuntu_setup.sh`

Execute the script now:

`sh my_ubuntu_setup.sh`

For any contributions, feel free to make a pull request.
